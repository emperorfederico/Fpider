# Fpider (Arduino Quadruped Spider Robot with Android)
### Required Modules
* **Servo Motors** x12 sg90 or mg90 (I prefer mg90 'cuz sg90 consists of plastic gears but mg90 steel gears, therefore torque becomes high.)
* **Arduino Uno** (If you are developing a multi-function project, you need to choose a higher processor. PIC,STM,RPi etc.)
* **Arduino Sensor Shield** (Required for motor and bluetooth connections.)
* **Bluetooth HC05 or HC06** (It doesn't matter, only difference is a button.)
* **Power Supply** (I prefer 7V Lipo battery.)
* **6 Axis Gyroscope**

### Description
Spider robot has four legs, each leg has three axes. (Servo Motors). This project includes the Proportional-Integral-Derivative system which is one of the closed loop control systems. The main part of the project is available on the Instructables page. The body of the spider will remain constant under all conditions. The gyroscope codes do not include the project.
